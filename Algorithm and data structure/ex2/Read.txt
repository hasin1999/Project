When looking at the data, we see that the algorithm takes longer to run as it compares more words. This makes sense because the algorithm checks each word in the dictionary against an input word to find the closest match based on edit distance. The time it takes seems to increase in a roughly straight line with the number of words compared, though there may be some differences depending on the dictionary used and the details of the word being checked.
